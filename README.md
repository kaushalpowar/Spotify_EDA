Whats better than extracting insights from Spotify?
I have used two datasets, <br/>spotify-dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lehaknarnauli/spotify-datasets?select=tracks.csv) and <br/>
Spotify Tracks DB(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db?select=SpotifyFeatures.csv)
